Ultimate_Theme_UI_Template
==========================

The ultimate open source Android theme and icon pack template

Do not expect this to work as of right now, it is a early work in progress.

This is utilizing tabs and a card listview to provide 3 (or more) swipable tabs that each have their own cardui listview for different actions.

The tabs are utilizing https://github.com/astuetz/PagerSlidingTabStrip

The cards are utilizing https://github.com/afollestad/Cards-UI

The intent is the following:

The first tab, named Theme, will contain a list of launchers that the theme will work for and apply to.
The second tab, named Extras, will contain a list of additiona items to the theme, this will be wallpapers, uccw skin downloads, and links to anything else you've created to match i.e. zooper widgets, apw etc.
The third tab, named Contact, will contain a list of social media cards, an email card and cards for web links and to play store.
The top left that currently contains a qucik contact icon will be converted to a share button that will share the theme's  play store link using Android's native share.

I would like to have it so that the names of the tabs, and the names for the cards are all strings. 

I will upload a current screenshot when I can.
